## Unreleased

Initial development. Not released.

- `make test-integration` now actually reaches MinIO. It ran the container's own
  `127.0.0.1` with no `--network host` and supplied none of the four
  `FILESTORAGE_S3_*` variables, so the documented recipe produced five *risky*
  tests — which a reader skims as a pass. The target now runs on host networking
  with the monorepo-root mount and defaults the variables to the documented
  container, each overridable from the environment.

- `FlysystemStore`: the store contract over any Flysystem adapter, with
  maintenance inventory and public/presigned URLs reported as nullable results
  rather than as interfaces that cannot vary at runtime.
- `FlysystemContentAddressableStore` and `AdapterSemantics`: deduplication, but
  only against an adapter whose atomic visibility and immutable content keys the
  application declares explicitly.
- `Url\TemporaryUrlOptionsInterface` with `Url\S3TemporaryUrlOptions`, so a
  presigned URL carries the group's delivery policy — or is not issued.
- `Stream\StreamWrapper`, which lets Flysystem read an upload straight through
  instead of copying it into `php://temp` first.
- A MinIO-gated integration suite covering presigned URLs, multipart uploads and
  content-addressed convergence, run in its own CI job.
